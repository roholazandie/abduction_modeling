        We would like to evaluate a machine learning model's ability to reason based on common sense.
        More specifically, we would like to see how accurately a model is able to generate a hypothesis of an event that
        can reasonably occur between two observations - Observation 1 and Observation 2.

        The model has generated a maximum of three hypotheses and we would like the mturk worker (human) to evaluate to
        tell us which of those hypotheses can be a reasonable hypotheses based on the actual hypothesis.
