<h2>Abduction Modeling Human Evaluation </h2>
<p>
    We would like to evaluate a machine learning model's ability to reason based on common sense.
    More specifically, we would like to see how accurately a model is able to generate a hypothesis of an event that
    can reasonably occur between two observations - Observation 1 and Observation 2.

    The model has generated a maximum of three hypotheses and we would like the mturk worker (human) to evaluate to
    tell us which of those hypotheses can be a reasonable hypotheses based on the actual hypothesis.
</p>
<h3>Observation 1</h3>
<p>{{ observation_1 }}</p>
<h3>Observation 2</h3>
<p>{{ observation_2 }}</p>
<h3>Actual Hypothesis </h3>
<p>{{ actual_hypothesis }}</p>
<h3>Model Generated Hypotheses </h3>
<ol>
    <li>{{ generated_hypothesis_1 }}</li>
    <li>{{ generated_hypothesis_2 }}</li>
    <li>{{ generated_hypothesis_3 }}</li>
</ol>
    <div>
    <h3>What do you think? Do the above model generated hypotheses make sense as compared to the actual hypothesis</h3>
        <p>Type in your answer in the text box below. You need to strictly follow the format of your answer.</p>
        <p>If all hypotheses make sense, type <b>1,2,3</b>.</p>
        <p>If only one of the hypotheses make sense (say the third hypothesis), type <b>3</b>.</p>
        <p>If two of the hypotheses make sense (say the second and third hypothesis), type <b>2,3</b>.</p>
        <p>If none of the hypotheses make sense, type <b>0</b>.</p>
